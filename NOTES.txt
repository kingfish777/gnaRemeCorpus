Course of action: 

1.) take account of PftML tales, build corpus
 * finish Russian on 20 tales
 * translate those to English
 * strategic markup of 60 more with these functions/content objects in evidence (based on Appendix III): 
     * cardinal function (a/A) --- every tale will have one of these by definition, 
       so would be interesting to be able to identify these and possibly categorize them, 
       based on Machine Learning as applied to PftML training corpus
     * Donor functions (DEF)
     * Wedding (w/W)
     * etc.

2.) framework for reproducible experimental procedure using best practices with respect to 
    scientific methodology (significance tests, null hypothesis, etc.)

3.) Source code: 
 * code to create language model (weighted DocumentTermMatrix)
 * code to create chunks for testing
 * code to transform "query chunk" into DocumentTermMatrix

4.) Other resources/tasks/considerations:
 * Cornell stopword list
 * key word filtering (these might be named entities) 
 * filter out personal names of protagonists, donors, villains
 * etc.
