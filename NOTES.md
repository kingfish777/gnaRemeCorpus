Course of action: 


1.) take account of PftML tales, build corpus TO DO

    * finish Russian on 20 tales
    * translate those to English
    * strategic markup of 60 more with these functions/content objects in evidence 
      (based on Appendix III):
        * cardinal function (a = lack/A = villainy) --- every tale will have one of these 
          by definition, so would be interesting to be able to identify these and possibly 
          categorize them, based on Machine Learning as applied to PftML training corpus
        * Donor functions (DEF)
        * Wedding (w/W)

2.) Source code TO DO

    * R code to create language model (weighted DocumentTermMatrix) using xpath 
      queries to PftML resource for a particular function in corpus 
      [easy --- have something like this already]
    * filter out personal names of protagonists, donors, villains [will write regular 
      expression/grep to search and replace with null/"" any capitalized words in Corpus 
      that appear in any location other than first word of a sentence]
    * code to create chunks for testing [medium hard --- donâ€™t have this]
    * code to transform "query chunk" into DocumentTermMatrix [medium easy]
