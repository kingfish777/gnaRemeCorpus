Course of action: 


1.) take account of PftML tales, build corpus TO DO

    * finish Russian on 20 tales
    * translate those to English
    * strategic markup of 60 more with these functions/content objects in evidence (based on Appendix III):
        * cardinal function (a/A) --- every tale will have one of these by definition, so would be interesting to be able to identify these and possibly categorize them, based on Machine Learning as applied to PftML training corpus
        * Donor functions (DEF)
        * Wedding (w/W)

2.) Source code TO DO

    * R code to create language model (weighted DocumentTermMatrix) using xpath queries to PftML resource for a particular function in corpus [easy --- have something like this
    * filter out personal names of protagonists, donors, villains [on the fence about this ... probably a good thing to do ... will write regular expression to search and replace any capitalized words in Corpus]
    * code to create chunks for testing [medium hard --- donâ€™t have this]
    * code to transform "query chunk" into DocumentTermMatrix [medium easy]
